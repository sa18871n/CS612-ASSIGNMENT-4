        It’s unbelievable that there was a time not in the distant past when chivalry was synonymous
        with respecting women. Chivalry was a moral and social code that distinguished people to
        belong to a higher section of society. In fact the quality was imperative for one to be
        successful. Though the dictionary would still show the meaning to be so, outside a dictionary
        chivalry is almost non-existent. I strongly believe that the status quo exists because it is no
        longer being consciously inculcated in today’s generation and hence not being imbibed by
        anyone. As a matter of course the perception of chivalry has undergone a drastic change. It is
        now an anomaly to find someone practice it. The rare occurrence of coming across a
        chivalrous gentleman only results in ridicule and misunderstanding. We pride ourselves in
        being broad minded but the sad truth is that most of us have put our blinkers on and failed to
        see the importance of carrying forward an impeccable quality like chivalry.
        Times may have changed but good manners never go out of fashion. Every era needs its fair
        share of gentlemen and so chivalry like old wine will revive itself in a new bottle. So, ready
        for a sip?
