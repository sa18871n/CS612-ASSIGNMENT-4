      Dhoni is the master of clutch moments. If India loses now, Dhoni would never be forgiven. All that he had achieved thus far would count for little. The media would vilify him, the fans would crucify him and the administration would desert him. Dhoni did not care. At least he did not care nearly enough not to make his move, to seize the moment by the scruff of the neck and make it his own. That night, to come ahead of Yuvraj required tremendous courage and monumental self-belief but more importantly it also required a pinch of madness and a sense of adventure. Dhoni clearly had all of them and then some more.

Soon enough, he would be joined by Yuvi. With 5 required off the last 2 overs, India had all but won the match. Yuvi takes a single; Dhoni decides that the time has come. The single-most iconic shot in modern Cricket. Kulasekara bowls. Dhoni tees off. The ball soars into the orbit. Time stands still. An eternity passes. He holds his pose. The nation stands up as one. He tracks the ball all the way to the stands. And then, he twirls his bat! India erupts. Yuvraj rushes over. Gives a bear hug to his skipper, buries his face into Dhoniâ€™s neck and cries. Dhoni stays calm, Dhoni remains cool. India has won the World Cup. Tendulkar lifts the trophy aloft. A billion rejoice. Dhoni quietly slinks away into the background.
